  // Steps to approach a recursive problem

  // 1.  Whatâ€™s the simplest possible input?

  // 2. Play around with examples and visualize (I always have paper at my desk as a dev)

  // 3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases 

  // 4. Generalise the Pattern

  // 5. Write code by combining recursive with pattern - code pretty much writes itself!
